## Quick Start

The [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) included in this kit is compiled with [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/) to reduce filesize on any unused classes and selectors. If you want to modify anything, just start the watcher to recompile it on the fly.

```
npm i && npm run watch
```

To compile for production again:

```
npm run production
```
