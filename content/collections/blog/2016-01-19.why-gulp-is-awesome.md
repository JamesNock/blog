title: 'Why Gulp is Awesome'
hero_image: gulp.webp
intro: '<p>I realised the other day that I had a project that contained 100’s of unminified JS files and decided to look for the most efficient way of automagically minifying them so that a) they are harder to read/unpick and b) the site will run faster; well web-application in this case.</p><p>I consulted the forums and got a tip to use ‘Gulp’.</p>'
