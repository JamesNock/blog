title: 'New website'
intro: '<p>For quite some time now I’ve shuddered at the state of my own website, it’s been looking very tired for a long time now and it’s not really been fit for purpose either. I launched it on 31st August 2015 back when I was looking for clients for some freelance work and it did well for the few years I needed it. However, I’ve not wanted to take on any new clients for quite some time now as I’m just too busy. It was time to get something put together that serves as less of an advertisement and more of an ‘about me’. So I did.</p>'
