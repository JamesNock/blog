title: 'How to deploy SvelteKit Sites to a DigitalOcean droplet'
intro: '<p>With all the recent fuss about a certain cloud provider billing someone a huge amount of money for a simple website that experienced a DDoS attack, it got me wondering &quot;how hard would it be to just deploy this stuff myself&quot;. The TL;DR is that it&#039;s not really <em>that</em> hard if you&#039;re patient.</p>'
