title: 'CraftCMS Flipbuilder Plugin'
hero_image: flipbook.jpg
intro: '<p>Recently, I ran into a problem whereby I needed to incorporate a magazine into a CraftCMS website that had been generated using a neat bit of software by the name of <a href="http://www.flipbuilder.com/">‘FlipBuilder’</a>. This would be a regular thing, so I was hoping I’d simply be able to drag and drop the outputted files into the <em>templates</em> folder and that it would magically work.</p><p>It didn’t.</p>'
