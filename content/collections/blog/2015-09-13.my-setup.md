title: 'My Setup'
intro: '<p>So I thought I’d kick-off my blog with info about my setup; hardware and software. I think it’s safe to say that every developer has their preferences in regards to just about everything when it comes to development; there is an infinite number of ways to get to an end product. My setup comes from my own preferences and is neither better or worse than the next developer’s; it really does come down to personal preference.</p>'

It’s worked for me flawlessly for a couple of years now and I’m confident that it’ll be good for another couple at least. To PC devotees the clock speed of the processor might seem a bit slow but it’s more than quick enough to power OSX Yosemite and everything else that I use on a daily-basis.'
